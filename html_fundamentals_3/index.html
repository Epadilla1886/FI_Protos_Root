Motivated and determined, I have set the bar high for myself and cannot wait to see what the future has in store.</p>

<div class="para">
    <p>Outside of basic html knowledge from past personal use, I have no real world in depth coding experience. My experience mainly consists of over fifteen years of sales, customer service and management. I thrive in high pressure team environments but I also step into a leader role when needed.</p>
